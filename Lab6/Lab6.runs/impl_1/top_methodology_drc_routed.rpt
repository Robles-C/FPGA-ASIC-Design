2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock sys_con/clk_wizard/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock sys_con/clk_wizard/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin sys_con/clk_wizard/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#1 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) XLEDS[0] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (XLEDS[0]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#2 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) XLEDS[1] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (XLEDS[1]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#3 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) XLEDS[2] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (XLEDS[2]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
Related violations: <none>

HPDR-1#4 Warning
Port pin direction inconsistency  
Hierarchical port(pin) XLEDS[3] direction INOUT is not consistent with the directions of the cell pins/ports found at that level of the netlist hierarchy. Please review the design and consider changing the port(pin) direction. Both drivers and loads were expected for the net (XLEDS[3]) connected to this Port, but both were not found.
