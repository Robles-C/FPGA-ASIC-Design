2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock clk_manager/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sys_clk_pin and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks sys_clk_pin and clk_out1_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sys_clk_pin] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock clk_manager/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin clk_manager/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on BTNR relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1, sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on BTNSa relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An input delay is missing on BTNSb relative to clock(s) sys_clk_pin
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LEDG relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LEDR relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on LEDY relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on RGB_B relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on RGB_G relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#9 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on RGB_R relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#10 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[0] relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#11 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[1] relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#12 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[2] relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#13 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[3] relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#14 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[4] relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#15 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on jc[5] relative to clock(s) clk_manager/inst/clk_in1
Related violations: <none>
